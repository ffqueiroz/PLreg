Description: Fitting power logit regression models for bounded
  continuous data, in which the density generator may be normal, Student-t, 
  power exponential, slash, hyperbolic, sinh-normal, or type II logistic. 
  Diagnostic tools associated with the fitted model, such as the residuals, 
  local influence measures, leverage measures, and goodness-of-fit statistics,
  are implemented. The estimation process follows the maximum likelihood approach
  and, currently, the package supports two types of estimators: the usual maximum 
  likelihood estimator and the penalized maximum likelihood estimator. More details
  about power logit regression models are described in 
  Queiroz and Ferrari (2022) <arXiv:2202.01697>.
